Bug reports and enhancement requests
------------------------------------

Bug reports and enhancement requests play a crucial role in improving the stability of ift_global. 

These are carefully managed through GitHub issues. When submitting an issue or request, it's essential to select the `appropriate category and complete the issue form comprehensively <https://github.com/iftucl/ift_global/issues/new/choose>`_. 

This ensures that both the community and the core development team can fully grasp the scope of the matter at hand.
To submit an issue, please visit our GitHub page and choose the relevant issue template. Providing detailed information helps us address your concerns more effectively and efficiently.

Once submitted, your issue becomes visible to the entire ift_global community. 

This opens the floor for additional comments, ideas, and discussions from other community members, fostering collaborative problem-solving and innovation.


Finding an issue to contribute to
---------------------------------

If you're new to ift_global or open-source development, we recommend exploring the GitHub "issues" `tab <https://github.com/iftucl/ift_global/issues>`_ to find tasks that interest you.

For newcomers, unassigned `issues labeled Docs <https://github.com/iftucl/ift_global/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3ADocs+no%3Aassigne>`_ and `good first issue <https://github.com/iftucl/ift_global/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee>`_ are excellent starting points.


After finding an issue you'd like to work on, assign it to yourself to prevent duplication of effort.

Simply comment with the word take on the GitHub issue to automatically assign it to yourself. This process may take a few seconds, and you might need to refresh the page to see the change.

If you're unable to continue working on an issue, please unassign it so others know it's available. Feel free to review the list of assigned issues, as some may no longer be actively worked on. If you're interested in an assigned issue, kindly ask the current assignee if you can take over, allowing at least a week of inactivity before considering the work discontinued.
We offer several :ref:`contributor community <community>` communication channels, which you're welcome to join. 

These include regular meetings for new contributors, dev meetings, a dev mailing list, and a Slack for the contributor community. All ift_global contributors are invited to these spaces to connect with each other. 

Remember, even our long-time maintainers were once in your position and are eager to welcome and support you as you familiarize yourself with our workflow and structure.
